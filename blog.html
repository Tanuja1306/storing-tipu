  <h1 class="animated bounce">My Interview Experience</h1>
  
  <p class="animated fadeInUpBig  ">Qualcomm visited our campus in August 2020 for hiring students for summer internship 2021 for software development profile. Open for all the Computer Science Students (Software Profile) with CGPA >=7 were eligible for round 1. <br><br>
The process had three rounds. <br><br>
Round 1:Logical Reasoning and Technical Test (13 August 2020)<br><br>
The test was conducted on HirePro platform. This was the online test conducted by Qualcomm, which consists of 60 Multiple Choice Questions, which we had to complete in 90 minutes. This test was divided into three sections, as follows.<br><br>
1. Aptitude and Logical Reasoning (20 Questions)<br>
2. General Programming  (20 Questions)<br>
3. CS Core Subjects Concepts  (20 Questions)<br><br>

Ten students were shortlisted in this round.<br><br>

Round 2: F2F Technical Interview<br><br>

The interview was held on Microsoft Teams, and it was 1 hour 10 minute long.
In this round, the interviewer commenced the interview with DSA based questions and asked me to code them (or just write the pseudocode for some) on a shared doc. The questions ranged from stacks, queues, STL and were mainly focused on code optimisation. He asked me to code a question: How to find duplicates in a sequence of numbers without storing anything (not even storing the sequence of numbers). I was able to solve all the questions quickly, and he was impressed. Then he discussed the projects mentioned on my resume. He mainly focused on my QT project and examined it for around 20 minutes. He asked me to explain various functions in the project and the experience in my previous internship. So this was all about my F2F Interview.<br><br>

Six students were shortlisted for the third round.<br><br>

Round 3: HR Round<br><br>
This round was 6 minutes long, and the interviewer was very amiable.
The round started with “tell me about yourself”.
She then simply asked why I would like to join their organisation and what are my key area of interest.<br><br>
That is all !! The result was announced in the evening on the same day, and a total of 6 people were selected <span style="color:orange">(including me)</span> &#128151.
